Two approaches for coffee machine have been implemented:

1. Without multi threading. (coffee.machine.CoffeeMachine)

   Test class @ coffee.machine.CoffeeMachineTest

2. Another with multi threading.(threaded.coffee.machine.ThreadedCoffeeMachine)
    Test class @ coffee.machine.threaded.ThreadedCoffeeMachineTest
    
    Approach #2 is unfinished as I did not get enough time as I realized too late that this was a multithreading problem.
